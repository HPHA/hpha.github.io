						<li>Spot lights to illuminate the Huron Pointe sign at Venetian and South River Rd are awaiting DTE planner approval and an estimate from an electrician</li>
						<li>Buoys at Lakeshore and South River Rd will be cleaned up and painted</li>
						<li>The HPHA board is looking at adding solar powered radar speed signs at strategic locations in Huron Pointe to help calm speeding, similar to the sign shown in George Victor’s earlier post</li>
						<li>The HPHA board is also looking into small medians/roundabouts that would be installed when the roads are resurfaced that would cause drivers to slow down enough to turn around them</li>
						<li>As stated in other posts any type of speed bump, speed hump, or speed dip is not permitted on public roads by the MCDOR</li>
						<li>If speeding within Huron Pointe is a concern of yours please voice your opinion to the Macomb County Sheriff at (586) 469-5151 or other traffic concerns can be directed to the Macomb County Department of Roads at (586) 463-8671</li>
						<li>The Huron Pointe garage sale will be on May 13-15</li>
						<li>Huron Pointe Walleye Tournament sponsored by Wilson Marine will be on June 11th, more details will be posted on here and www.hpha.us or contact Tony Zadonia</li>
						<li>Huron Pointe Dinghy Poker Run will be in August (date and locations TBD), if you have any interest in helping out with this event or volunteering your house as a stop please contact Anna Marie Robinson</li>
						<li>The north Lakeshore Dr bridge is currently on or ahead of schedule and should be completed in early June</li>
						<li>The south Lakeshore Dr bridge was pushed back a little due to the FAA involvement but is still scheduled to be completed in 2016, please check Steve Marino’s earlier post for details</li>
						<li>The egress/ingress to the Archer/Lakeshore/Pardee canal is not closed by the Coast Guard as previously thought, be aware that depending on the construction work being done the workers can stop boat from coming through for safety and also the canal has not been dredged and may have debris that could damage a boat, boats going through are doing so at their own risk</li>
						<li>For those interested in weed control for the canals or helping with collecting funds for weed control here is a list of the captains that handle each canal, you can send a private message to Ken Mulder to get the contact information to any of the captains or to volunteer
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Archer/Lakeshore/Pardee canal</strong> – Ken Mulder 
								<li><strong>West Archer/East Archer canal</strong> – currently no captain
								<li><strong>Venetian canal</strong> – currently no captain
								<li><strong>Powers/Riverdale canal</strong> – currently no captain
								<li><strong>Huron Pointe/Circle canal</strong> – Jeff Papsdorf
								<li><strong>Circle/Lakeville canal</strong> – Dave Kowachek
								<li><strong>Lakeville/Lakeshore canal</strong> – Bill Schebil
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Stop signs at the intersections of the bike path and Huron Point roads and also garbage cans along the bike path were discussed and being looked at, just a reminder that pedestrians have the right of way when crossing the road</li>
						<li>It was brought up that Huron Pointe residents should be aware of the water quality in Lake St Clair and the sewage that is being dumped in the lake and Clinton River, for more information you can check out groups like www.savelakestclair.org and contact any of your local, state, and federal representatives and let them know that this is important to you and your neighbors, also be aware of Lake St Clair Metro Park beach closings due to E coli because we are so close it can be a good gauge of the water quality in the canals</li>

						<li>There were two residents elected to the board, Anna Robinson and Ken Mulder. The board now consists of:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>President</strong> - Anna Robinson</li>
								<li><strong>V.P.</strong> - Joe Raymon</li>
								<li><strong>Secretary</strong> - Ken Mulder</li>
								<li><strong>Treasurer</strong> - Dave Fisher</li>
								<li><strong>Trustee</strong> - Don Boden</li>
								<li><strong>Trustee</strong> - Bill Melching</li>
								<li><strong>Trustee</strong> - Tony Zadonia</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Steve Marino provided an update regarding the timeline of the N. Lakeshore bridge construction and opened it up to a Q and A session. Additional items that were discussed were a proposed Euchre tournament at HPYC, Walleye tournament at Wilson Marine this Spring, and residents inquired about several items, such as posting detour signs during Lakeshore shut down, walkway after Pardee bridge removal, white lines on Archer dividing traffic, and beautifying the entrance to the neighborhood. Also, a committee was formed to award “best landscaping” awards throughout the neighborhood.</li>
							<li>The board will take your ideas into consideration when developing projects, events and initiatives this year. We will meet as a board every other month to ensure we are on track with any and all activities, and we will hold open meetings quarterly, at minimum, to provide status updates and solicit feedback from residents. Updates and communications will also be posted on both Facebook pages as we are one community. I am hopeful we can continue the momentum that we saw with the bridge survey, and continue to get residents involved with events, committees, etc.</li>

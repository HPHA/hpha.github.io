                <p>
                    Annual dues are $25 and allow members to vote on any item brought up by the board, members are eligible for
elections, and your dues help fund neighborhood events. Dues also allow the HPHA to keep residents informed,
maintain and improve entrances ($20,000 cost in the last 10 years), and address issues that benefit all residents. For
questions about current membership standing please contact Treasurer Dave Fisher at <a href="mailto:dfisher@hpha.us">dfisher@hpha.us</a>

                <h3>What does the HPHA do for me?</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the things HPHA does on an ongoing basis or has done in the past:
                </p>                
                <ul>                    
					<li>Neighborhood block party/5K run/walk.</li>
					<li>Inspired the Harrison Township Board of Trustees to establish the Township Environmental Committee.</li>
					<li>Promote clean water initiative educational campaign; “Our Water, Our Future, Ours to Protect”</li>

					<li>Networks with other area homeowner associations on items of mutual concern.</li>
					<li>Organizes waterway treatment programs for invasive species of weeds. HPHA pays for the required DEQ treatment permit each year. We have been doing this for 30 years</li>

					<li>Advises Township Board of Trustees, Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Appeals on all matters under consideration which may have an effect on our subdivision.</li>

					<li>Organizes and advertises the annual 850 home subdivision garage sale.</li>
					<li>Sponsored annual “Breakfast with the Easter Bunny” for neighborhood children and parents. </li>
					<li>We did this 4 or 5 years ago but we stop doing it because no one from the sub attended.</li>
					<li>HPHA led the donation campaign which resulted in Automatic External Defibrillators (AED’s) being carried in local Sheriff patrol vehicles within our Township. Something we did about 10 years ago. It was a one time event but the units are in use today.</li>
					<li>Recognized resident accomplishments through awarding of annual prizes for the Garden of the Year contest.</li>
					<li>Prizes for the best decorated house at Christmas for several years.</li>
					<li>Instrumental in defeat of a proposed Township ordinance requiring all homes to pass a building inspection prior to the sale of the home.</li>
					<li>Meets with Local, State & Federal Representatives for the betterment of community interests.</li>
					<li>Maintains this web site for subdivision information.</li>
